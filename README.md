# ScreenSaverMinimal
Template for Screensaver for OS X and macOS with Swift 3

The project can help as starting point when programming a OS X/macOS Screensaver in Swift 3.

It offers basic code for a ScreenSaverView implementation, and further contains a simple example for a ConfigureSheet including storage of configuration data in the ScreenSaverDefaults.

A second target called 'SaverTest', allows for simple testing and debugging of parts of the ScreenSaver by rendering the view and the ConfigureSheet inside a Cocoa app.



Guillaume Louel forked and updated this Template for Swift 5 https://github.com/glouel/ScreenSaverMinimal
